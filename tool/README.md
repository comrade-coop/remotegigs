### 3. How to filter the offers

The filter is set by [criteria.yaml](https://github.com/comrade-coop/remotegigs/blob/master/TOOL/criteria.yaml) in the tool's directory.The filter is separated by two groups: 

**includesAll** and includesAny

The result in the command line tool is the combined one from both groups. You can comment with "#" any of the labels you do not want to use.

*Example:

```
includesAll: 
  - 'Frontend' 
  - 'Angular'
  
includesAny:
  - 'Full Stack'
  - 'C++'
```
